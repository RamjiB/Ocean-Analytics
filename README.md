# Ocean-Analytics
COVID 19 has an impact on the global economy as well as heath. Particularly, the ocean is vital to the worldâ€™s economy, with more than 90% of trade using sea routes and as a source of jobs for millions of people [1]. The ocean based industries include oil and gas, fishing, aquaculture, shipping, tourism, energy, mining, and marine biotechnology. Ocean health includes marine life, sea level rise, sea surface parameters such as temperature, wind pressure, etc. Finding the changes involved with any one of these parameters can show the Covid 19 impacts. Based on the open source availability of the data, the sea surface temperature (geospatial data) is used to interpret ocean health, the vessel traffic (ground data) and market changes in the energy industry are used to interpret ocean economy. 

## Hypothesis:
- Since there was less ocean traffic during Covid 19 period, the ocean health improvement should be seen. 
- Since there was less ocean traffic during Covid 19 period, the ocean economy must have been affected.
